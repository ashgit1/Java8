Method References:
==================

Method references help to point to methods by their names. 
A method reference is described using :: (double colon) symbol. 
A method reference can be used to point the following types of methods.

1. Static methods
2. Instance methods
3. Constructors using new operator (TreeSet::new)

example : MethodReferences1.java

Note:
=====
Here we have passed System.out::println method as a static method reference.

Another Example :  MethodReferences2.java
